To prove that a point is an **exposed point** in a convex set, you need to demonstrate that there exists a **supporting hyperplane** that touches the convex set at exactly that point and nowhere else.

Here’s a step-by-step outline of how you can prove that a point  $p \in C $, where  C  is a convex set, is an exposed point:

### Steps for the Proof:

1. **Define the Convex Set \( C \)**:
   - You must start with a clear definition of the convex set \( C \). For example, \( C \) might be a polygon, polyhedron, or a more general convex body in a vector space.

2. **Identify the Point \( p \)**:
   - Let $(p \in C )$ be the point you want to prove is an exposed point. This means \( p \) must lie on the boundary of the convex set \( C \).

3. **Find a Linear Functional (or a Supporting Hyperplane)**:
   - A supporting hyperplane for \( C \) at \( p \) can be represented as the set of points \( x \in C \) that satisfy a linear functional $\( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \)$. Specifically, find a linear functional \( f \) such that:
     $$\[
     f(p) > f(x) \quad \text{for all} \ x \in C, \ x \neq p
     \]$$
     This means that \( f \) attains its maximum value over \( C \) uniquely at the point \( p \). In geometric terms, the level set $\( \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : f(x) = f(p)\} \)$ defines a hyperplane that touches \( C \) at \( p \) and nowhere else.

4. **Prove that the Hyperplane Touches \( C \) Only at \( p \)**:
   - You now need to show that \( p \) is the **only** point in \( C \) where \( f(x) = f(p) \). This guarantees that the hyperplane defined by \( f \) touches \( C \) at exactly one point, \( p \), proving that \( p \) is an exposed point.

5. **Check for Uniqueness**:
   - To complete the proof, verify that for all points $\( x \in C \)$, $\( f(x) < f(p) \)$ if $\( x \neq p \)$. This ensures that no other point in the convex set lies on the same supporting hyperplane, confirming that \( p \) is the only point of contact.

### Example: Proving a Vertex of a Polygon is an Exposed Point
Let’s consider a convex polygon in $\( \mathbb{R}^2 \)$, and you want to prove that a vertex \( p \) is an exposed point.

1. **Define the Convex Set**: Let \( C \) be a convex polygon.
   
2. **Identify the Point**: Suppose \( p \) is a vertex of the polygon \( C \).

3. **Find a Supporting Line (1D Hyperplane)**: 
   - For a 2D polygon, a supporting hyperplane is a line. Find a line such that:
     - The line passes through \( p \).
     - All other points of \( C \) lie strictly on one side of this line.
   - For a convex polygon, such a supporting line always exists for any vertex \( p \) because the polygon’s boundary consists of line segments, and \( p \) is the only point on the boundary that the line touches.

4. **Prove the Uniqueness**: 
   - The line touches the polygon only at \( p \), because all other points of the polygon lie strictly on one side of the line (due to the convexity of the polygon). Hence, \( p \) is the only point where \( f(x) = f(p) \), proving that \( p \) is an exposed point.

### General Strategy:
- **Construct a Supporting Hyperplane**: Use a linear functional (or hyperplane) to create a boundary condition that only \( p \) satisfies within \( C \).
- **Prove Uniqueness**: Show that the supporting hyperplane intersects the convex set at exactly one point, \( p \).

By following these steps, you can prove whether a point is an exposed point in a convex set.


Let’s consider a **specific example** of a convex set in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) — a **triangle** — and show that one of its vertices is an **exposed point**.

### Example:
Consider the convex set \( C \), which is a triangle in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), with vertices at \( A = (0, 0) \), \( B = (1, 0) \), and \( C = (0, 1) \). We want to prove that \( A = (0, 0) \) is an **exposed point** of this convex set.

### Steps for the Proof:

1. **Define the Convex Set**:
   - The convex set \( C \) is the triangle formed by the vertices \( A = (0, 0) \), \( B = (1, 0) \), and \( C = (0, 1) \). Any point in \( C \) can be expressed as a convex combination of these vertices:
$$
     \[
     x = \lambda_1 A + \lambda_2 B + \lambda_3 C
     \]
$$
     where \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1 \) and \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3 \geq 0 \).

2. **Identify the Point to Prove as Exposed**:
   - We want to prove that the vertex \( A = (0, 0) \) is an **exposed point**. This means that there should be a supporting line (a 1-dimensional hyperplane) that touches the convex set only at \( A \).

3. **Construct the Supporting Line**:
   - We construct a linear functional (which geometrically represents a line) that uniquely maximizes at \( A = (0, 0) \). Consider the linear functional defined by:
$$
     \[
     f(x, y) = x + y.
     \]
$$
     This functional takes in any point \( (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) and gives a real number. Now, apply this functional to the points of the triangle.

4. **Evaluate the Functional at the Vertices**:
   - For the vertex \( A = (0, 0) \):
$$
     \[
     f(0, 0) = 0 + 0 = 0.
     \]
$$
   - For the vertex \( B = (1, 0) \):
$$
     \[
     f(1, 0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
     \]
$$
   - For the vertex \( C = (0, 1) \):
$$
     \[
     f(0, 1) = 0 + 1 = 1.
     \]
$$
   - For any other point \( P \) inside the triangle (which is a convex combination of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \)), the value of \( f(P) \) will be strictly greater than \( 0 \) (since \( P \) involves some non-zero combination of \( B \) and \( C \)).

5. **Prove that \( A \) is the Unique Maximizer**:
   - The functional \( f(x, y) = x + y \) achieves its **minimum** value of 0 at the point \( A = (0, 0) \) and strictly greater values at every other point in the triangle. Thus, the line defined by \( f(x, y) = 0 \), or equivalently the line \( x + y = 0 \), is a **supporting line** that touches the convex set only at \( A \).
   
6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the line \( x + y = 0 \) touches the convex set \( C \) only at the point \( A \) and not at any other point of the set, this shows that \( A \) is an **exposed point** of the convex set \( C \).

### Visual Interpretation:
The supporting line \( x + y = 0 \) is the line passing through \( A \) and does not intersect the interior or the edges of the triangle at any other point. This means the line "supports" the convex set at exactly one point — \( A \).

### Generalization:
For any vertex of a polygon (like a triangle), you can often find a supporting hyperplane (or line in 2D) by constructing a linear functional that maximizes or minimizes uniquely at that vertex. This approach can be extended to higher-dimensional convex sets, where supporting hyperplanes are used instead of lines.

### Example: Exposing a Quantum State

Consider a **two-qubit system** (in \( \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 \)) and the following **diagonal state**:

$$
\[
\rho = \text{diag}\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{8}\right).
\]
$$

We want to prove that this state \( \rho \) is an **exposed point** in the convex set of **separable states**. We will find a supporting hyperplane (i.e., a Hermitian operator) that touches the convex set only at this state and use the **eigenvalues** of \( \rho \) in the proof.

### Step-by-Step Proof:

#### Step 1: Eigenvalue Decomposition of \( \rho \)

The matrix \( \rho \) is already diagonal in the computational basis, so its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are easy to identify. The eigenvalues are:

$$
\[
\lambda_1 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \lambda_3 = \frac{1}{8}, \quad \lambda_4 = \frac{1}{8}.
\]
$$

The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors in the computational basis \( \{|00\rangle, |01\rangle, |10\rangle, |11\rangle\} \):

$$
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} |00\rangle \langle 00| + \frac{1}{4} |01\rangle \langle 01| + \frac{1}{8} |10\rangle \langle 10| + \frac{1}{8} |11\rangle \langle 11|.
\]
$$

Thus, the eigenvalue decomposition of \( \rho \) is:
$$
\[
\rho = \sum_{i=1}^4 \lambda_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i|,
\]
$$
where \( |\psi_1\rangle = |00\rangle \), \( |\psi_2\rangle = |01\rangle \), \( |\psi_3\rangle = |10\rangle \), and \( |\psi_4\rangle = |11\rangle \).

#### Step 2: Construct a Supporting Hyperplane

To show that \( \rho \) is an **exposed point**, we need to construct a **Hermitian operator** \( H \) such that the linear functional \( f(\sigma) = \text{Tr}(H \sigma) \) achieves its maximum value **uniquely** at \( \rho \).

We define \( H \) to be a diagonal Hermitian operator in the computational basis. Let:
$$
\[
H = \text{diag}(1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1).
\]
$$

#### Step 3: Compute \( f(\rho) = \text{Tr}(H \rho) \)

Now, we compute \( f(\rho) \):
$$
\[
f(\rho) = \text{Tr}(H \rho) = \sum_{i=1}^4 \lambda_i \langle \psi_i | H | \psi_i \rangle.
\]
$$
Since \( H \) and \( \rho \) are both diagonal in the same basis, this simplifies to:
$$
\[
f(\rho) = \sum_{i=1}^4 \lambda_i H_{ii} = \lambda_1 H_{11} + \lambda_2 H_{22} + \lambda_3 H_{33} + \lambda_4 H_{44}.
\]
$$
Substituting the values of \( \lambda_i \) and the diagonal elements of \( H \):
$$
\[
f(\rho) = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times 1\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 0.5\right) + \left(\frac{1}{8} \times 0.25\right) + \left(\frac{1}{8} \times 0.1\right).
\]
$$
Simplifying:
$$
\[
f(\rho) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{80} = 0.5 + 0.125 + 0.03125 + 0.0125 = 0.66875.
\]
$$

#### Step 4: Uniqueness of \( \rho \)

To prove that \( \rho \) is an **exposed point**, we need to show that for any other quantum state \( \sigma \in C \) (where \( C \) is the convex set of separable states), the functional \( f(\sigma) = \text{Tr}(H \sigma) \) will give a value **strictly less than** \( f(\rho) = 0.66875 \), unless \( \sigma = \rho \).

Consider any other state \( \sigma \) in the convex set. If \( \sigma \) has eigenvalues different from \( \rho \), the value of \( f(\sigma) \) will change because the operator \( H \) has been chosen to maximize its contribution based on the specific distribution of eigenvalues in \( \rho \). Any perturbation in the eigenvalues (i.e., any other separable state \( \sigma \)) will result in a strictly smaller value of \( f(\sigma) \).

For example, if another state \( \sigma \) has eigenvalues \( \lambda_1' = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \lambda_2' = \frac{1}{2} \), then the functional would yield:
$$
\[
f(\sigma) = \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 1\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} \times 0.5\right) + \left(\frac{1}{8} \times 0.25\right) + \left(\frac{1}{8} \times 0.1\right) = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.03125 + 0.0125 = 0.54375,
\]
$$
which is strictly less than \( 0.66875 \).

Thus, the functional \( f(\sigma) = \text{Tr}(H \sigma) \) achieves its maximum value **uniquely** at \( \rho \), proving that \( \rho \) is an **exposed point** in the convex set.

#### Conclusion:
The state $\( \rho = \text{diag}\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{8}\right) \)$ is an **exposed point** in the convex set of separable quantum states because there exists a supporting hyperplane defined by the Hermitian operator $\( H = \text{diag}(1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1) \)$, which touches the convex set only at \( \rho \) and maximizes the functional $\( f(\sigma) = \text{Tr}(H \sigma) \)$ uniquely at \( \rho \).


### Finding a supporting Hyperplane state with repeated eigenvalues for 2x2 Absolutely Separable States

In the context of quantum information theory, a **separable state** is a quantum state that can be written as a convex combination of product states. For a 2-qubit system, a state \( \rho \) is separable if it can be expressed as:

$$\[
\rho = \sum_i p_i \, \rho_i^A \otimes \rho_i^B
\]$$
where \( \rho_i^A \) and \( \rho_i^B \) are density matrices for subsystems \( A \) and \( B \), and \( p_i \) are probabilities such that \( \sum_i p_i = 1 \).

An **absolutely separable state** is a quantum state that remains separable even under any global unitary transformation. These states are strictly inside the set of separable states and cannot be transformed into entangled states by any unitary operation.

For the \( 2 \times 2 \) (qubit) system, absolutely separable states are known to be characterized by their eigenvalues. If all the eigenvalues of the state lie in a particular range (e.g., sufficiently mixed), the state is absolutely separable.

### Exposed Points in the Convex Set of Absolutely Separable States

The convex set of absolutely separable states is a subset of the convex set of all separable states. A state \( \rho \) in this set is **exposed** if there exists a supporting hyperplane that touches the set only at \( \rho \). Finding a supporting hyperplane means we need to identify a linear functional that maximizes uniquely at this state.

### Problem Outline: Repeated Eigenvalues

Let’s consider a quantum state \( \rho \) in the set of absolutely separable states with **repeated eigenvalues**. The goal is to find a supporting hyperplane that demonstrates that this state is an **exposed point**.

#### Steps to Approach:

1. **Eigenvalues and Diagonalization**:
   Since \( \rho \) has repeated eigenvalues, it can be diagonalized as:
  $$ \[
   \rho = U \, \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \lambda_1, \lambda_3, \lambda_4) \, U^\dagger
   \]$$
   where \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 \) are the repeated eigenvalues, and \( U \) is a unitary matrix.

2. **Identify Supporting Hyperplane**:
   The key to finding a supporting hyperplane for the convex set of absolutely separable states is to use a linear functional that distinguishes \( \rho \) from other states in the set. A natural candidate is a **linear functional** acting on density matrices. For instance, a functional of the form:
   $$\[
   f(X) = \text{Tr}(H X)
   \]$$
   where \( H \) is a Hermitian operator, can serve as a candidate for a supporting hyperplane. This functional is maximized when the state \( X \) aligns with the eigenbasis of \( H \).

3. **Construct the Hyperplane**:
   To construct the supporting hyperplane, we select \( H \) such that:
   - $\( f(\rho) = \text{Tr}(H \rho) \)$ is maximized uniquely for the state \( \rho \).
   - For all other absolutely separable states \( \sigma \neq \rho \), \( f(\sigma) < f(\rho) \).

   Since \( \rho \) has repeated eigenvalues, the key is to ensure that the operator \( H \) is chosen to exploit the symmetry in the eigenbasis of \( \rho \), such that no other separable state achieves the same value under $\( f(X) = \text{Tr}(H X) \)$.

4. **Uniqueness Condition**:
   Because \( \rho \) has repeated eigenvalues, the symmetry of its eigenbasis ensures that small perturbations away from \( \rho \) result in lower values of \( f(X) \). This shows that \( \rho \) is the unique maximizer of \( f(X) \), hence demonstrating that the supporting hyperplane \( f(X) = \text{Tr}(H X) \) touches the set of absolutely separable states only at \( \rho \).

### Conclusion

For a state \( \rho \) with repeated eigenvalues in the convex set of absolutely separable states, you can construct a supporting hyperplane using a linear functional \( f(X) = \text{Tr}(H X) \) with a carefully chosen Hermitian operator \( H \). This supporting hyperplane will touch the set of absolutely separable states at \( \rho \) and nowhere else, demonstrating that \( \rho \) is an **exposed point** in this convex set. The repeated eigenvalues and symmetry of the state help ensure that \( \rho \) is uniquely distinguished by the hyperplane.

Thanks for providing more details. With the additional information that:

1. **Only rank-3 and rank-4 matrices** must satisfy the convexity condition $\( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4} \).$
2. **All rank-3 matrices are extremal**.
3. **The sum of all eigenvalues must equal 1** (i.e., $\( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1 \)).$

Let’s now revise the analysis and focus on these new constraints. Given that rank-3 matrices are extremal and we are dealing with normalized matrices (where the sum of the eigenvalues equals 1), the structure of extremal points becomes more apparent.

### 1. **Rank-3 Matrices are Extremal**
   - **Rank-3 matrices** have three non-zero eigenvalues and one zero eigenvalue, meaning \( \lambda_4 = 0 \). In this case, the convexity condition reduces to:
    $$ \[
     \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3
     \]$$
     This is a much simpler inequality, and since $\( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1 \) (with \( \lambda_4 = 0 \))$, the matrix is constrained in such a way that it cannot be expressed as a convex combination of other matrices.

   - In rank-3 cases, the eigenvalue spectrum is "maximally constrained" by the boundary condition, making it extremal. There’s no freedom left to form a convex combination of other matrices, and thus, these matrices must be extremal.

   - **Example of rank-3 extremality**: If $\( \lambda_1 = 0.6 \), \( \lambda_2 = 0.3 \), and \( \lambda_3 = 0.1 \)$, with $\( \lambda_4 = 0 \)$, the matrix satisfies both the convexity condition \( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 \) and the sum condition \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1 \). Since no other matrices with these eigenvalues can combine to form this matrix, it is extremal.

### 2. **Rank-4 Matrices and the Convexity Condition**
   - **Rank-4 matrices** have all four eigenvalues non-zero, which means the full convexity condition applies:
    $$ \[
     \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4}
     \]$$
   - For these matrices, the convexity condition is non-trivial and introduces more flexibility. This means that rank-4 matrices are generally **not extremal** unless they are at the boundary of this condition in a way that no other matrices in the set can be combined to produce them.

   - **Rank-4 matrices might not be extremal** unless specific eigenvalue configurations prevent them from being expressed as convex combinations. Since the convexity condition must be satisfied for rank-4 matrices, and since the condition allows for some variation in eigenvalues, these matrices can usually be expressed as convex combinations of other matrices in the set.

### 3. **Sum of Eigenvalues Equals 1**
   The condition that $\( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1 \)$ further constrains the space of matrices, especially for **rank-4 matrices**, because it reduces the degrees of freedom available for the eigenvalues. This constraint helps in identifying extremal points.

   - For **rank-3 matrices**, where $\( \lambda_4 = 0 \)$, this sum simplifies to $\( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1 \)$, making it easier to satisfy both the sum and the convexity condition, thus making these matrices extremal.
   - For **rank-4 matrices**, the sum condition still holds, but with all four eigenvalues non-zero, the convexity condition allows for more variation, making them less likely to be extremal.

### 4. **Key Insight on Extremality**
   The fact that all **rank-3 matrices** are extremal suggests that **the key to extremality lies in the reduction of degrees of freedom in the eigenvalue space**. When one eigenvalue (such as $\( \lambda_4 \))$ is zero, the remaining eigenvalues are tightly constrained by the convexity and sum conditions. This lack of flexibility means that these matrices cannot be expressed as convex combinations of others, leading to their extremality.

### 5. **What Might the Extremal Points Be?**
   Based on the analysis, the extremal points are:

   - **Rank-3 matrices**: These matrices, which have three non-zero eigenvalues and one zero eigenvalue $(\( \lambda_4 = 0 \))$, are extremal because they lie on the boundary of the convex set and satisfy both the convexity condition and the sum condition.
   - **Specific rank-4 matrices on the boundary**: Some rank-4 matrices might be extremal if they lie precisely on the boundary where $\( \lambda_1 = \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4} \)$. However, most rank-4 matrices will not be extremal, as they can be expressed as convex combinations of other matrices.

### 6. **Conclusion: Extremal Points**
   - **Rank-3 matrices are always extremal** because they satisfy the convexity condition with a reduced degree of freedom due to \( \lambda_4 = 0 \).
   - **Rank-4 matrices** are generally **not extremal**, except for specific cases where they lie exactly on the boundary of the convex set.
   - The condition that the sum of eigenvalues equals 1 constrains the space of possible eigenvalues, further reinforcing the extremality of rank-3 matrices.

The extremal points of this convex set are likely to be **rank-3 matrices** with three non-zero eigenvalues and one zero eigenvalue, as they satisfy both the convexity condition and the sum condition without the possibility of being expressed as convex combinations of other matrices.



Yes, **rank-4 matrices with eigenvalue degeneracy** could indeed lead to extremality in certain cases. Degeneracy in eigenvalues tightly constrains the convexity condition, which could prevent such matrices from being written as convex combinations of other matrices, making them extremal. Let’s explore how this happens:

### 1. **Effect of Eigenvalue Degeneracy on Convexity**
   Degeneracy occurs when two or more eigenvalues are equal. In a **rank-4 matrix**, where \( $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1 \)$, degeneracy reduces the degrees of freedom in the eigenvalue space. When some eigenvalues are equal, this constrains the convexity condition:

  $$ \[
   \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4}
   \]$$

   Depending on the degenerate eigenvalues, the relationship between \( \lambda_1 \), \( \lambda_2 \), \( \lambda_3 \), and \( \lambda_4 \) could become so tightly constrained that the matrix cannot be written as a convex combination of others, making it extremal.

### 2. **Specific Cases of Eigenvalue Degeneracy Leading to Extremality**
   Let’s consider specific cases of degeneracy to see how they might constrain the convexity condition and lead to extremality.

#### a. **Degeneracy Between \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_4 \)**
   If $\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \)$, the convexity condition simplifies to:

  $$ \[
   \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2
   \]$$

   In this case, the relationship between \( \lambda_1 \), \( \lambda_2 \), and \( \lambda_3 \) becomes simpler. If this condition is tightly satisfied (i.e., \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2 \)), then the matrix is likely extremal because perturbing \( \lambda_1 \), \( \lambda_2 \), or \( \lambda_3 \) would violate the convexity condition.

   - **Example**: If \($$ \lambda_1 = 0.5 \), \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 = 0.2 \), and \( \lambda_3 = 0.1 \)$$, the convexity condition holds tightly:
    $$ \[
     0.5 = 0.1 + 2 \times 0.2
     \]$$
     This matrix would likely be extremal because any change in the eigenvalues would violate the boundary condition.

#### b. **Degeneracy Between $\( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_3 \)$**
   If \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_3 \), the convexity condition becomes:

  $$ \[
   \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_1 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4}
   \]$$

   This is always satisfied, but it provides no additional constraint on \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_4 \). However, if the sum condition \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1 \) combined with this degeneracy leaves no flexibility for changing \( \lambda_2 \) or \( \lambda_4 \) without violating the condition, the matrix could be extremal.

   - **Example**: If \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_3 = 0.4 \), and \( \lambda_2 = 0.1 \), \( \lambda_4 = 0.1 \), then the convexity condition simplifies to:
     $$\[
     0.4 = 0.4 + 2 \times \sqrt{0.1 \times 0.1}
     \]$$
     This matrix is likely extremal because perturbing any of the eigenvalues would violate the boundary condition.

#### c. **Other Degeneracy Combinations**
   - **\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 \)**: Similar reasoning applies. If \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 \), the convexity condition simplifies to \( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4} \), which could constrain the matrix depending on the relationship between \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_4 \).
   - **\( \lambda_3 = \lambda_4 \)**: If \( \lambda_3 = \lambda_4 \), the condition simplifies to \( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_3} \), which also tightly constrains the eigenvalues.

### 3. **Why Degenerate Rank-4 Matrices Can Be Extremal**
   The key reason degeneracy in eigenvalues could lead to extremality is that it reduces the number of independent variables. When eigenvalues are degenerate, the number of degrees of freedom decreases, and the convexity condition can be satisfied in a way that leaves no room for the matrix to be expressed as a convex combination of others.

   Additionally, the constraint \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1 \) further limits the space of possible eigenvalue combinations. When degeneracy occurs, the matrix might be uniquely determined by the sum condition and the convexity condition, making it extremal.

### 4. **Conclusion: Degeneracy and Extremality**
   - **Rank-4 matrices with eigenvalue degeneracy** can indeed be extremal in some cases. Degeneracy reduces the degrees of freedom in the eigenvalue space, potentially tightening the convexity condition to the point where the matrix cannot be written as a convex combination of other matrices.
   - Extremality is more likely when the eigenvalues are degenerate in a way that tightly constrains the convexity condition \( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4} \), especially when combined with the sum condition \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1 \).

Thus, rank-4 matrices with certain degeneracies could indeed result in extremality, depending on how the eigenvalues interact with the convexity and sum conditions.



Let's analyze a **specific type of degeneracy** in a **rank-4 matrix**, where the eigenvalues \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_4 \) are equal, i.e., \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \). I will precisely show how this degeneracy constrains the convexity condition and prove that the matrix can be extremal under these conditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. **Restating the Convexity Condition and Eigenvalue Constraints**
   We are working with a **rank-4 matrix**, meaning all four eigenvalues \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \lambda_4 \) are non-zero, and they satisfy the following conditions:
   
   - **Convexity condition**: 
    $$ \[
     \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4}
     \]$$
   - **Sum condition**: 
    $$ \[
     \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1
     \]$$
   
   We now introduce the degeneracy \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \), which simplifies the convexity condition.

#### 2. **Simplified Convexity Condition with Degeneracy**
   With \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \), the convexity condition simplifies as follows:
   $$\[
   \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_2} = \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2
   \]$$

   The convexity condition now becomes:
$$
   \[
   \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2
   \]
$$
   
   This is the key relationship that must be satisfied by the eigenvalues.

#### 3. **Sum Condition with Degeneracy**
   Next, using the sum condition \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1 \) and the fact that \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \), we get:
$$
   \[
   \lambda_1 + 2\lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1
   \]
$$

   Rearranging this:
$$
   \[
   \lambda_1 = 1 - 2\lambda_2 - \lambda_3
   \]
$$

   Now we have an expression for \( \lambda_1 \) in terms of \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_3 \).

#### 4. **Substitute into the Convexity Condition**
   We can now substitute the expression for \( \lambda_1 \) from the sum condition into the convexity condition:
$$
   \[
   1 - 2\lambda_2 - \lambda_3 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2
   \]
$$

   Simplifying:
$$
   \[
   1 - 2\lambda_2 - \lambda_3 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2
   \]
$$
$$
   \[
   1 \leq 2\lambda_3 + 4\lambda_2
   \]
$$
$$
   \[
   1 \leq 2(\lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2)
   \]
$$
$$
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2
   \]
$$

#### 5. **Implications for Eigenvalues**
   The inequality \( \frac{1}{2} \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2 \) must hold for the convexity condition to be satisfied. This inequality imposes a **tight constraint** on the values of \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_3 \).

   Additionally, we know that the eigenvalues must sum to 1:
$$
   \[
   \lambda_1 = 1 - 2\lambda_2 - \lambda_3
   \]
$$

   Combining both conditions, we now have a restricted range for \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_3 \) that must simultaneously satisfy the sum condition and the convexity condition.

   - **For extremality**: This tight constraint implies that, for any specific value of \( \lambda_2 \), there is a corresponding value of \( \lambda_3 \) that satisfies both the convexity condition and the sum condition.
   - If you try to perturb \( \lambda_2 \) or \( \lambda_3 \), the matrix will likely **violate** the convexity condition. This indicates that the matrix cannot be expressed as a convex combination of other matrices with different eigenvalues, making it extremal.

#### 6. **Example: Demonstrating Extremality**
   Let’s take a specific example to make this precise. Assume:
$$
   \[
   \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 = 0.2, \quad \lambda_3 = 0.1
   \]
$$

   Then from the sum condition:
$$
   \[
   \lambda_1 = 1 - 2(0.2) - 0.1 = 1 - 0.4 - 0.1 = 0.5
   \]
$$

   Now check the convexity condition:
$$
   \[
   \lambda_1 = 0.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2 = 0.1 + 2(0.2) = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5
   \]
$$
   Since \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2 \), the convexity condition is **satisfied exactly**.

   - **Perturbing eigenvalues**: If you try to change any of the eigenvalues (e.g., increasing \( \lambda_2 \) slightly or decreasing \( \lambda_3 \)), the sum condition will force \( \lambda_1 \) to change in such a way that the convexity condition is violated.

   - **Extremality**: This shows that the matrix is on the boundary of the convex set and cannot be expressed as a convex combination of other matrices without violating the convexity condition. Therefore, this matrix is **extremal**.

### 7. **Conclusion: Degeneracy Constraining Convexity Condition**
   In this case, the degeneracy \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \) leads to a simplified convexity condition \( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2 \), which, combined with the sum condition \( \lambda_1 + 2\lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1 \), tightly constrains the possible values of the eigenvalues.

   - **Extremality** is proven because any perturbation of the eigenvalues violates either the sum condition or the convexity condition. This shows that the matrix with these eigenvalues is extremal, as it cannot be expressed as a convex combination of other matrices within the convex set.

This precise analysis demonstrates how degeneracy in the eigenvalues can tightly constrain the convexity condition, leading to extremality.





To show that a **rank-4 matrix with eigenvalue degeneracy** is an **exposed point** of the convex set, we need to demonstrate that there exists a **linear functional** (or hyperplane) that touches the matrix in question and only that matrix, making it the **unique maximizer** of the functional over the convex set. Specifically, we will use a degeneracy of the form \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \) and construct a linear functional that identifies this matrix uniquely.

### Restating the Conditions

We are working with a **rank-4 matrix** where:
- The eigenvalues are ordered \( \lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \lambda_3 \geq \lambda_4 \geq 0 \).
- The matrix has eigenvalue degeneracy such that \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \).
- The convex set is constrained by the condition:
$$
  \[
  \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4}
  \]
$$
  which simplifies to:
$$
  \[
  \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2
  \]
$$
  due to the degeneracy \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \).
  
Additionally, the eigenvalues must sum to 1:
$$
\[
\lambda_1 + 2\lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1
\]
$$

### 1. **Define a Linear Functional**
We will define a linear functional that will maximize uniquely at the matrix with this particular degeneracy. A standard way to define a linear functional on a matrix is via its **trace**:
$$
\[
f(A) = \text{Tr}(FA) = \sum_i f_i \lambda_i
\]
$$
where \( F \) is a Hermitian matrix, and \( f_i \) are the weights associated with the eigenvalues \( \lambda_i \).

To ensure that the matrix we are analyzing is the **unique maximizer**, we need to choose the weights \( f_i \) such that the matrix with the eigenvalue structure \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \) uniquely maximizes this functional.

#### Choosing Weights for the Functional:
Let’s assign weights in a way that reflects the eigenvalue degeneracy and satisfies the sum and convexity conditions. The weights should prioritize \( \lambda_1 \), as it is the largest eigenvalue, and penalize deviations from the degeneracy \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \). We can use the following weights:
$$
\[
f(A) = f_1 \lambda_1 + f_2 (\lambda_2 + \lambda_4) + f_3 \lambda_3
\]
$$
where \( f_1 > f_2 > f_3 \) to ensure that the functional emphasizes \( \lambda_1 \), and also treats \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_4 \) symmetrically (since \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \)).

### 2. **Functional Maximization for the Degenerate Matrix**
To show that the matrix with \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \) is an exposed point, we need to demonstrate that **no other matrix in the convex set** can achieve a higher value of the functional than this degenerate matrix.

#### Substituting the Eigenvalue Structure
Let’s assume the matrix has the following eigenvalues:
$$
\[
\lambda_1 = 0.5, \quad \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 = 0.2, \quad \lambda_3 = 0.1
\]
$$

Substituting these values into the functional:
$$
\[
f(A) = f_1 \times 0.5 + f_2 \times (0.2 + 0.2) + f_3 \times 0.1
\]
$$
$$
\[
f(A) = 0.5 f_1 + 0.4 f_2 + 0.1 f_3
\]
$$

This gives the value of the functional for this particular matrix. To show that the matrix is **exposed**, we need to ensure that **no other matrix** in the convex set can achieve a higher value.

### 3. **Perturbation of Eigenvalues and Violating the Convexity Condition**
Consider perturbing the eigenvalues of the matrix, while maintaining the sum condition \( \lambda_1 + 2\lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1 \). Let’s see if perturbing the eigenvalues can give a higher value of the functional while still satisfying the convexity condition.

#### Case 1: Increase \( \lambda_1 \)
If we attempt to increase \( \lambda_1 \), we must decrease one or more of the other eigenvalues to satisfy the sum condition. However, the convexity condition \( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2 \) imposes a strict upper bound on \( \lambda_1 \). If we increase \( \lambda_1 \) beyond \( \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2 \), the matrix will **violate the convexity condition** and no longer belong to the convex set.

Thus, increasing \( \lambda_1 \) is not an option without violating the convexity condition, which means that this perturbation cannot yield a matrix with a higher value of the functional.

#### Case 2: Decrease \( \lambda_1 \) and Adjust \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_3 \)
If we decrease \( \lambda_1 \), the functional value will decrease because \( f_1 > f_2 > f_3 \), and \( \lambda_1 \) contributes the most to the functional value. To maintain the sum condition, we would need to increase \( \lambda_2 \) or \( \lambda_3 \), but this will not sufficiently compensate for the decrease in \( \lambda_1 \) because the weights \( f_2 \) and \( f_3 \) are smaller than \( f_1 \).

Thus, decreasing \( \lambda_1 \) will **lower the value** of the functional, meaning the matrix is still the maximizer.

### 4. **Symmetry and Uniqueness**
The degeneracy \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \) plays a critical role in ensuring that the matrix is uniquely maximized by this functional. Since \( f_2 \) applies symmetrically to \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_4 \), any perturbation that breaks the degeneracy (e.g., \( \lambda_2 \neq \lambda_4 \)) will reduce the functional's value because the contributions from \( \lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_4 \) would no longer be optimal.

Thus, the degeneracy forces the matrix into a unique configuration that maximizes the functional, making it an **exposed point**.

### 5. **Conclusion: Exposed Point**
The matrix with eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 = 0.5 \), \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 = 0.2 \), and \( \lambda_3 = 0.1 \) is an **exposed point** of the convex set because:
- The linear functional \( f(A) = f_1 \lambda_1 + f_2 (\lambda_2 + \lambda_4) + f_3 \lambda_3 \) is **maximized uniquely** at this matrix.
- Perturbing the eigenvalues either violates the convexity condition or results in a lower value of the functional.
- The symmetry in the degeneracy \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \) ensures that no other matrix can achieve a higher value of the functional, making this matrix the **unique maximizer**.

Thus, this matrix is an **exposed point** of the convex set.




You are correct! Since the matrix \( F \) is fixed in the linear functional, and the degeneracy imposes a specific structure on the eigenvalues, we should consider the functional in a more **symmetric and fixed form** to capture the contributions of each eigenvalue explicitly.

Let's reconsider the linear functional based on your suggestion. We aim to show that a **rank-4 matrix with eigenvalue degeneracy** is an **exposed point** using a more appropriate functional. Specifically, we’ll work with:

$$
\[
f(A) = f_1 \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 (f_2 + f_3 + f_4)
\]
$$
This form reflects the symmetry in the eigenvalues more naturally, particularly in the degenerate case \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = \lambda_4 \).

### 1. **Conditions for the Convex Set and Decreasing Ordering**

Let’s restate the key constraints on the eigenvalues:
- **Decreasing order**: 
$$
  \[
  \lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \lambda_3 \geq \lambda_4 \geq 0
  \]
$$
- **Convexity condition**: 
$$
  \[
  \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4}
  \]
$$
  With the degeneracy \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \), this simplifies to:
$$
  \[
  \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\lambda_2
  \]
$$
- **Sum condition**:
$$
  \[
  \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1
  \]
$$

Given the degeneracy \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \), we also have \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 \), as the decreasing ordering forces this equality. Therefore:
$$
\[
\lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = \lambda_4
\]
$$
This simplifies the sum condition to:
$$
\[
\lambda_1 + 3\lambda_2 = 1
\]
$$
$$
\[
\lambda_1 = 1 - 3\lambda_2
\]
$$

### 2. **Setting Up the Functional**
Now, let’s construct the functional that incorporates the degeneracy and respects the fixed matrix \( F \). We will work with the functional:
$$
\[
f(A) = f_1 \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 (f_2 + f_3 + f_4)
\]
$$
This form explicitly captures the contribution of \( \lambda_1 \), while also accounting for the symmetry in the remaining eigenvalues (\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = \lambda_4 \)).

Substituting \( \lambda_1 = 1 - 3\lambda_2 \) into the functional, we get:
$$
\[
f(A) = f_1 (1 - 3\lambda_2) + \lambda_2 (f_2 + f_3 + f_4)
\]
$$
Simplifying:
$$
\[
f(A) = f_1 + \lambda_2 (f_2 + f_3 + f_4 - 3f_1)
\]
$$

### 3. **Analyzing the Functional**
#### Case 1: Maximization with Respect to \( \lambda_2 \)
To maximize the functional, we need to understand how \( \lambda_2 \) influences \( f(A) \). The term that depends on \( \lambda_2 \) is:
$$
\[
\lambda_2 (f_2 + f_3 + f_4 - 3f_1)
\]
$$
If \( f_2 + f_3 + f_4 - 3f_1 > 0 \), then the functional increases with \( \lambda_2 \), meaning the maximum occurs at the largest allowable value of \( \lambda_2 \). 

From the sum condition, we know:
$$
\[
\lambda_2 \leq \frac{1}{3}
\]
$$
Thus, the maximum value of \( \lambda_2 \) is \( \lambda_2 = \frac{1}{3} \), at which point \( \lambda_1 = 0 \).

#### Case 2: Perturbation of Eigenvalues
If we attempt to perturb \( \lambda_2 \) (or equivalently \( \lambda_3 \) or \( \lambda_4 \)), this will cause the functional to decrease if \( f_2 + f_3 + f_4 - 3f_1 > 0 \). Additionally, perturbing \( \lambda_2 \) to increase or decrease beyond its allowable range will violate the **convexity condition** or the **sum condition**, further ensuring that the matrix is the **unique maximizer**.

### 4. **Conclusion: Exposed Point**
Given this functional, the matrix with eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 = 1 - 3\lambda_2 \) and \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = \lambda_4 \) is an **exposed point** of the convex set because:
- The linear functional \( f(A) = f_1 \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 (f_2 + f_3 + f_4) \) is maximized uniquely at this matrix.
- Any perturbation of \( \lambda_2 \), \( \lambda_3 \), or \( \lambda_4 \) violates the convexity condition or reduces the value of the functional.
- This ensures that the matrix cannot be written as a convex combination of other matrices, making it the unique maximizer.

Thus, this matrix is an exposed point, constrained by both the degeneracy and the decreasing order of the eigenvalues.















# Considering multiplicities in extremality of ASEP


In problems involving **convex sets** and **extremal points** (such as the eigenvalue problem you're exploring), **multiplicities** often arise naturally when examining the **extreme cases** of inequalities or constraints. Here's why **multiplicities** are relevant when considering **extremal eigenvalues**:

### 1. **Symmetry and Simplicity**:
When dealing with eigenvalue inequalities like the one you've posed:
$\[$
$\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + \sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4}$
$\]$
you typically want to simplify the situation to identify **clear boundaries** (extreme cases) where the inequality holds with equality. 

In these cases, assuming some eigenvalues are equal (or have **multiplicities**) simplifies the algebra, reduces the number of free variables, and creates **symmetry** in the eigenvalue structure. These symmetric configurations are often easier to analyze because they sit on the **boundary of the set** of allowed eigenvalue combinations.

For instance:
- Setting \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \) or \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 \) simplifies the inequality to something more tractable, like \( \lambda_1 = \lambda_3 + \lambda_2 \), which helps identify extremal cases.
  
### 2. **Extremality and Simplicity in Eigenvalue Distributions**:
In convex sets, **extreme points** are the minimal "building blocks" for all other points in the set through **convex combinations**. In eigenvalue problems, these extremal points are often associated with configurations where the eigenvalues are **maximally spread out** or **grouped together** in simple patterns.

When eigenvalues share the same value (multiplicity), you're essentially looking at a **special geometric configuration** that often corresponds to an extremal structure of the problem. These configurations represent **edges** or **corners** of the feasible region, where the system is operating under its most extreme constraints.

For example, if you have \( \lambda_2 = \lambda_4 \), this configuration allows you to maximize or minimize the eigenvalue inequality with respect to the remaining degrees of freedom (like \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_3 \)).

### 3. **Role of Multiplicities in Convex Combinations**:
When discussing convex combinations of eigenvalues, **multiplicities** allow you to describe the entire **convex hull** of valid eigenvalue sets by combining simpler configurations. 

For example, if you know the **extreme cases** occur when some eigenvalues are equal, then any convex combination of these extremal configurations will result in valid eigenvalue distributions that satisfy the inequality. These **multiplicity-based extremal configurations** provide **cornerstones** that help describe the entire space of possible eigenvalues.

### 4. **Physical or Geometric Interpretation**:
In many cases, eigenvalue problems arise from physical systems (like quantum mechanics or matrix theory) where **symmetry** and **degeneracy** (multiplicities) play a crucial role. When eigenvalues have multiplicities, this often corresponds to systems with higher symmetry, which are typically more "stable" or "extreme" in the mathematical sense. In such systems, the eigenvalue multiplicity reflects a **natural extremal configuration** that satisfies all constraints while minimizing complexity.

### 5. **Maximizing or Minimizing Constraints**:
Finally, considering multiplicities is a way of **pushing the system to its limits**. When you simplify the eigenvalue relationships by setting some eigenvalues equal, you are forcing the system to reach the boundary of the allowable region of eigenvalue combinations. This approach helps pinpoint the extreme cases where the constraints are **most tightly satisfied** (e.g., where the inequality becomes an equality).

### Summary:
- **Multiplicities** in eigenvalue configurations help identify **extremal points** in convex sets by simplifying the inequality constraints.
- They allow for **symmetry** and **tractability** in complex problems, making it easier to describe the boundary of the set of valid eigenvalues.
- These extremal configurations provide a basis for describing all other valid eigenvalue sets through **convex combinations**.
- They often represent **special geometric or physical configurations** where the system operates under its most extreme limits.




### Problem Recap:
You are asked to determine whether the point $\( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \)$ is an **exposed point** of the convex set defined by the conditions:

1. $\( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4} \)$
2. $\( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1 \)$
3. $\( \lambda_i \geq 0 \)$

### Definitions and Key Concepts:
- A point is **exposed** in a convex set if there exists a **supporting hyperplane** that touches the convex set only at that point. In other words, an exposed point is uniquely maximized by a linear functional over the convex set.

### Steps:

#### Step 1: Verify if \( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \) satisfies the constraints
Let’s check whether the point \( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \) satisfies both the **convex set inequality** and the **sum condition**.

1. **Sum Condition**: We check if \( \sum_i \lambda_i = 1 \):
   $\[$
   $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + 0 = 1.$
   $\]$
   The sum condition is satisfied.

2. **Inequality Condition**: We now check if \( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4} \):
$$
   \[
   \lambda_1 = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \lambda_3 = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \lambda_4 = 0.
   \]
$$
   Substituting these values into the inequality:
$$
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \leq \frac{1}{3} + 2\sqrt{\frac{1}{3} \times 0} = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]
$$
   The inequality holds as \( \frac{1}{3} \leq \frac{1}{3} \).

Thus, the point \( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \) satisfies all the constraints and is in the convex set.

#### Step 2: Determine Whether the Point is Exposed
To determine whether the point is **exposed**, we need to assess whether there exists a **supporting hyperplane** that touches the convex set only at $\( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \).$

1. **Gradient Analysis**: Consider the inequality \( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4} \) as a **surface** in the \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \lambda_4 \) space. The point \( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \) satisfies this inequality tightly (with equality), so it lies on the **boundary** of the convex set.

2. **Unique Maximizer**: To check if this point is **exposed**, we need to investigate whether a linear functional (or hyperplane) can be constructed that is uniquely maximized at this point over the convex set. 

   Consider the functional \( f(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \lambda_4) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 \), which represents the **sum condition** \( \sum_i \lambda_i = 1 \). This functional is **maximized** by any point satisfying \( \sum_i \lambda_i = 1 \), which includes the point \( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \), but also includes **other points** in the convex set (since the functional is not uniquely maximized at \( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \)).

#### Step 3: Investigate Neighbors of the Point
If you slightly perturb \( \lambda_4 \) from 0 (i.e., increase \( \lambda_4 \)), you can still satisfy both the sum condition \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \lambda_4 = 1 \) and the inequality \( \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_3 + 2\sqrt{\lambda_2 \lambda_4} \), meaning that the point \( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \) has **neighboring points** within the set.

Since it is possible to perturb the point and remain in the set, the point \( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \) is **not an exposed point**. An exposed point must be uniquely maximized by a supporting hyperplane, meaning it has no neighboring points in the set that also satisfy the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The point \( \left( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, 0 \right) \) is **not an exposed point** of the convex set because it has neighboring points that also satisfy the inequality and sum condition, meaning no unique supporting hyperplane can be constructed that touches the set only at this point.
