==$$==

==Find an expression for the operator norm.==
To find the **operator norm** of the operator:

$$
\[
T = \sum_i (\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i) \ketbra{e_i}{e_i} \otimes \ketbra{\psi_i}{\psi_i},
\]
$$

we need to compute the **largest singular value** (or the largest absolute value of the eigenvalues, since \( T \) is diagonal in the basis $\( \{|e_i\rangle \otimes |\psi_i\rangle \}\)).$

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### 1. Understanding the Operator:
The operator \( T \) acts on a tensor product space, and it is given in a diagonal form. In this case, \( \ket{e_i} \) and \( \ket{\psi_i} \) form orthonormal bases for the first and second subsystems, respectively. The operator \( T \) is represented as:

$$
\[
T = \sum_i (\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i) \ketbra{e_i}{e_i} \otimes \ketbra{\psi_i}{\psi_i}.
\]
$$

This operator is diagonal in the product basis \( \{|e_i\rangle \otimes |\psi_i\rangle\} \), and its action on any basis vector \( |e_i\rangle \otimes |\psi_i\rangle \) is simply:

$$
\[
T (|e_i\rangle \otimes |\psi_i\rangle) = (\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i) (|e_i\rangle \otimes |\psi_i\rangle).
\]
$$

So, the eigenvalues of \( T \) are \( (\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i) \).

#### 2. Definition of the Operator Norm:
The **operator norm** of \( T \) is defined as the maximum absolute value of its eigenvalues:
$$
\[
\| T \| = \sup_{\|v\| = 1} \| T v \| = \max_i |\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i|.
\]
$$

#### 3. Eigenvalues of \( T \):
The eigenvalues of \( T \) are \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i \), where \( \lambda_i \) are the eigenvalues of the second subsystem. Hence, the operator norm is determined by finding the **largest absolute value** of the set \( \{\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i\} \).

#### 4. Expression for the Operator Norm:
The operator norm of \( T \) is simply the **maximum** absolute value of the differences \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i \). Therefore, the operator norm is given by:

$$
\[
\| T \| = \max_i |\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i|.
\]
$$

### Conclusion:
The operator norm of the operator \( T = \sum_i (\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i) \ketbra{e_i}{e_i} \otimes \ketbra{\psi_i}{\psi_i} \) is:

$$
\[
\boxed{\| T \| = \max_i |\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i|.}
\]
$$

This represents the largest deviation of \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 \) from any of the eigenvalues \( \lambda_i \).

==**Find conditions for which this norm is strictly less than 1**==
We are given the operator:

$$
\[
T = \sum_i (\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i) \ketbra{e_i}{e_i} \otimes \ketbra{\psi_i}{\psi_i},
\]
$$
and we know that its **operator norm** is given by:

$$
\[
\| T \| = \max_i |\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i|.
\]
$$

We are asked to find the conditions under which this norm is **strictly less than 1**, i.e.,

$$
\[
\max_i |\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i| < 1.
\]
$$

### Step-by-Step Approach:

#### 1. Norm Condition:
The operator norm is the maximum of the absolute values of \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i \), so the condition \( \|T\| < 1 \) means:

$$
\[
|\alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i| < 1 \quad \text{for all} \ i.
\]
$$

This condition implies that \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 \) must be **close to each** \( \lambda_i \), but not farther than 1 in either direction. This gives the following two inequalities for each \( i \):

$$
\[
-1 < \alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i < 1.
\]
$$

#### 2. Rearrange the Inequalities:

Now, let's solve this for \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 \) in terms of \( \lambda_i \).

- The left inequality \( -1 < \alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i \) becomes:
$$
  \[
  \alpha^2 \beta^2 > \lambda_i - 1.
  \]
  
$$
- The right inequality \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 - \lambda_i < 1 \) becomes:
$$
  \[
  \alpha^2 \beta^2 < \lambda_i + 1.
  \]
$$

#### 3. Combined Condition:

Thus, for each \( i \), we have the following condition on \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 \):

$$
\[
\lambda_i - 1 < \alpha^2 \beta^2 < \lambda_i + 1.
\]
$$

This inequality must hold for **all** eigenvalues \( \lambda_i \).

#### 4. Global Condition:
To satisfy this condition for all \( i \), we must find a range for \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 \) that fits within the bounds for the **smallest** and **largest** eigenvalues of \( \lambda_i \).

Let \( \lambda_{\text{min}} = \min_i \lambda_i \) and \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \max_i \lambda_i \). The strict inequality \( \| T \| < 1 \) becomes:

$$
\[
\lambda_{\text{min}} - 1 < \alpha^2 \beta^2 < \lambda_{\text{max}} + 1.
\]
$$

### 5. Final Condition:
Thus, the condition for \( \|T\| < 1 \) is:

$$
\[
\boxed{\lambda_{\text{min}} - 1 < \alpha^2 \beta^2 < \lambda_{\text{max}} + 1.}
\]
$$

This provides the range for \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 \) such that the operator norm of \( T \) is strictly less than 1. Specifically, \( \alpha^2 \beta^2 \) must lie within 1 unit of each eigenvalue \( \lambda_i \), bounded by the smallest and largest eigenvalues of \( \lambda_i \).
